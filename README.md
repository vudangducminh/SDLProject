# SDLProject
Note: I configure the setting based on my configuration in tetr.io (looks pretty weird because my left and right arrow are malfunctioned in my laptop)
- ',' to move pieces to the left
- '/' to move pieces to the right
- '.' to soft drop
- 'space' to hard drop
- 'X' to rotate clockwise
- 'Z' to rotate counter-clockwise
- 'C' to hold a piece
- 'A' to rotate 180
